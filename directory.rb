# Refactor notes: used inline if for name input to make different kind of
# conditional looping. Changed the way the student input methods worked as the
# loops were unnecessary within method and very unweildy to refactor. Refactored
# filters to condense the code and simplify the methods. Want to remove input
# methods from this file into another, then call on file for functionality. Is
# it worth making a module or class for this?
